    <h1>How We Work</h1>

    <p>
      Signal Thread exists to help organizations make sense of operational data
      that has grown across systems, time, and changing requirements.
      Our work is structured, careful, and grounded in how data was actually created.
    </p>

    <h2>Gather</h2>
    <p>
      We begin by understanding where data originates, how it was recorded,
      and the operational constraints under which it was created.
      This includes legacy systems, historical practices, and implicit assumptions.
    </p>

    <h2>Interpret</h2>
    <p>
      We reconcile differences in structure, terminology, and historical usage
      so information can be viewed consistently and accurately.
      Analysis is grounded in real workflows, not abstract models.
    </p>

    <h2>Guide</h2>
    <p>
      We help organizations understand what the data can reliably support,
      where uncertainty remains, and how to move forward with clarity.
